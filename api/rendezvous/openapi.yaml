  title: FDO Rendezvous Server API
  version: 0.0.1
  description: |
    API for the FDO Rendezvous Server role. The Rendezvous Server acts as an intermediary
    between devices and owners during the device onboarding process (TO2 protocol).
    It manages trusted device CA certificates to verify device authenticity.

    This specification aggregates the following management APIs:
    - Trusted Device CA Certificates (/device-ca)

      description: |
        Uploads one or more PEM-encoded certificates for trusted device certificate authorities.
        A single PEM file may contain multiple certificates.

        This operation is idempotent:
        - Valid, non-expired certificates that don't exist in the database are imported
        - Certificates that already exist (duplicate fingerprint) are silently skipped
        - Expired certificates are silently skipped
        - Malformed or invalid certificates are silently skipped

        The response includes statistics and detailed messages about the operation:

        - `detected`:  Total number of parsable certificate blocks found in the PEM data.
        - `malformed`: Number of PEM blocks that could not be parsed as valid certificates.
        - `imported`:  Number of new, valid certificates successfully imported into the database.
        - `skipped`:   Number of parsable certificates that were not imported. This includes certificates that were expired or already exist in the database.
        - `messages`:  Array of detailed status messages for each certificate processed
